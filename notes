Mongo DB is a NOSQL database.
NOSQL database means data is not stored in particular structure.
NOSQL databases are more flexible to unexpected data.

In mongo db data is stored in collections
collections don't have rows and columns, data is stored in form of object.

We can connect more than database in node js

While using updateOne if there are more than one records/documents in database that matches the given condition then only first one will match.
Use updateMany to update all the records.
